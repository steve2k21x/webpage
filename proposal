# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Owl Chapter Homepage

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The homepage displays the homepage of Temple's Owl Chapter of Groove Phi Groove Social Fellowship Inc. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The homepage will give display of what the chapter does at Temple and also what it does as a national organization. Also introduces the board members on the page as well. I'll be mainly using HTML as the language

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to have a good amount of the information about the organization and pictures of people and events

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think i can finish the  main description of the organization on the homepage

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to finish everything including the pictures of the board members and their description


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First thing I will do is do my research on HTML as it is my first time using this language. I'll look up youtube videos, anything that will help me familiarize myself witht he language. I'll gather all information of my organization from my knowledge and the national website. I will also ask my fellow board members for a description and pictures that they would want as well.
